Bugs:

- Some GUIs changes are not syncing (Door guis and health station guis for example.)
- Clientside cameras guis are not working
- Elevators working laggy (improved but still laggy)
- npc binded light not working
- PDA tip message is empty
- Closing pda shows the wrong anim (raise instead of lower)
- Downloading emails does not work clientside
- NPCs keep talking if you just look at them (focus) without pressing click to talk again
- Location position in player GUIs is not shown
- Enviro Suit is not working

PER MAP:

- Mars city 1:
  + laser scan does not make any sound at all

- Mars city 2:
  + Kelly video not playing

- Alpha labs sector 2
	+ GUI cameras not working

 - Phobos labs 2: After deafiting invulnerability hunter, there is a repeated idMsg bit overflow. (not crash but spam the console each frame)
 - Phobos labs 3: same idMsg bit overflow (I believe this is related to the player picking up the invulnerability hunter artifact upgrade)
